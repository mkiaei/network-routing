DESCRIPTION
------------
A simulation framework for demand routing in mesh networks
version 1.0 2015-08-30
Author: Mohammad Kiaei

-----
NOTES
-----
- A heap implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is used for routing demands.
- Network topology is read from a ".top" file.
- Demand set is read from a ".dem" file.
- Program tested in Visual C++ 2010 Express and g++ version 4.8.4.
